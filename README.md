# Libembroidery v1.0-alpha

(Under construction, please wait for v1.0 release.)

libembroidery is a low-level library for reading, writing, 
and altering digital embroidery files in C.

libembroidery is the underlying library that is used by [Embroidermodder 2](http://embroidermodder.org)
and is developed by [The Embroidermodder Team](#the-embroidermodder-team).
It handles over 45 different embroidery specific formats as well
as several non-embroidery specific vector formats.

It also includes a CLI called `embroider` that allows for better automation of
changes to embroidery files and will be more up-to date than
the Embroidermodder 2 GUI.

If you want to learn more about building, using and developing this software read the
manual (included as the file [embroidermodder_manual.pdf](embroidermodder_manual.pdf)).
