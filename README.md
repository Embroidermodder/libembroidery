What is libembroidery ?
-----------------------

libembroidery is the underlying library that is used and
developed by [Embroidermodder 2](http://embroidermodder.github.io).
It handles over 45 different embroidery specific formats as well
as several non-embroidery specific vector formats.

Build
-----

libembroidery and EmbroiderModder 2 use CMake builds
so if you are building the project to use as a library we recommend:
 
```
git clone https://github.com/Embroidermodder/libembroidery
cd libembroidery
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

This builds both the static and shared versions of the library as well
as the command line program `embroider`.

License
-------

Libembroidery is distributed under the permissive zlib licence, see the LICENSE
file.

Documentation
-------------

For users, we recommend you build as above then run:

```
./embroider
```

which will print out advice on how to use these tools without digging
straight into the source code.

Beyond this the full documentation is in libembroidery_v0.1_manual.md.
