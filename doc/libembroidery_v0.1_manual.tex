\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Libembroidery is a library for manipulating, converting and creating
embroidery files between all major embroidery machine formats and some
graphics formats to aid the creation of designs.

Most of the supported formats are in an experimental state as the
library is under active development.

The library has 3 intended user interfaces: the GUI in EmbroiderModder2,
the CLI in \texttt{embroider} (see embroider-main.c) and Arduino
embedded systems (libembroidery.ino). The most actively maintained user
interface is the CLI \texttt{embroider}.

Format comments are thanks to tspilman@dalcoathletic.com who's
notes appeared at \url{http://www.wotsit.org} under Tajima Format.

\subsubsection{Header}

The header seems to contain information about the design.
Seems to be ASCII text delimited by 0x0D (carriage returns).
This must be in the file for most new software or hardware
to consider it a good file! This is much more important
than I originally believed. The header is 125 bytes in
length and padded out by 0x20 to 512 bytes total.
All entries in the header seem to be 2 ASCII characters
followed by a colon, then it's value trailed by a carriage return.

\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{>{\hsize=0.3\hsize}X >{\hsize=0.7\hsize}X}
\texttt{char LA[16+1];} & First is the 'LA' entry, which is the design name with no
path or extension information. The blank is 16 characters
in total, but the name must not be longer that 8 characters
and padded out with spaces (0x20). \\
\hline
\texttt{char ST[7+1];} & Next is the stitch count ST, this is a 7 digit number
padded by leading zeros. This is the total stitch count
including color changes, jumps, nups, and special records. \\
\hline
\texttt{char CO[3+1];} & Next, is CO or colors, a 3 digit number padded by leading
zeros. This is the number of color change records in the file. \\
\hline
\texttt{char POSX[5+1];} & Next is +X or the positive X extent in centimeters, a 5
digit non-decimal number padded by leading zeros. \\
\hline
\texttt{char NEGX[5+1];} & Following is the -X or the negative X extent in millimeters,
a 5 digit non-decimal number padded by leading zeros. \\
\hline
\texttt{char POSY[5+1];} & Again, the +Y extents. \\
\hline
\texttt{char NEGY[5+1];} & Again, the -Y extents. \\
\hline
\texttt{char AX[6+1];} \break\ \texttt{char AY[6+1];} & AX and AY should express the relative coordinates of the
last point from the start point in 0.1 mm. If the start
and last points are the same, the coordinates are (0,0). \\
\hline
\texttt{char MX[6+1];} \break\ \texttt{char MY[6+1];} &
 MX and MY should express coordinates of the last point of
the previous file for a multi-volume design. A multi-volume design means a design
consisted of two or more files. This was used for huge designs that can not be stored in a
single paper tape roll. It is not used so much (almost never) nowadays. \\
\hline
\texttt{char PD[9+1];} & PD is also storing some information for multi-volume design.
\end{tabularx}

Uses 3 byte per stitch encoding with the format as follows:

\begin{tabularx}{1.1\columnwidth}{X | X X X X X X X X}
Bit & 7 & 6 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\
Byte 0 & y+1 & y-1 & y+9 & y-9 & x-9 & x+9 & x-1 & x+1 \\
Byte 1 & y+3 & y-3 & y+27 & y-27 & x-27 & x+27 & x-3 & x+3 \\
Byte 2 & jump & color \break\ change & y+81 & y-81 & x-81 & x+81 & set & set
\end{tabularx}

T01 and Tap appear to use Tajima Ternary.
 
Where the stitch type is determined as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Normal Stitch `00000011 0x03`
\item Jump Stitch `10000011 0x83`
\item Stop/Change Color `11000011 0xC3`
\item End Design `11110011 0xF3`
\end{itemize}

Inclusive or'ed with the last byte.

Note that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The max stitch length is the largest sum of `1+3+9+27+81=121` where the unit length is 0.1mm so 12.1mm.
\item The co-ordinate system is right handed.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Development}

A \emph{right-handed co-ordinate system} is one where up is positive and right is positive. Left-handed is up is positive, left is positive. Screens often use down is positive, right is positive, including the OpenGL standard so when switching between graphics formats and stitch formats we need to use a vertical flip (\texttt{embPattern\_flip}).

\texttt{0x20} is the space symbol, so when padding either 0 or space is preferred and in the case of space use the literal ' '. Use the macros:

\begin{verbatim}
#define PAD_SPACE(n) \
    embFile_pad(currentFile, ' ', n)
#define PAD_ZERO(n) \
    embFile_pad(currentFile, 0, n)
\end{verbatim}

to save writing functions that may not inline.

\section{Design Philosophy and Coding Standards}

\begin{itemize} 
\item No GUI code will be present here.
\item The library will be written in pedantic ANSI C/C90, aiming for no compiler warnings under GCC for compatibility with the most possible platforms.
\item The command line program `embroider` targets 32-bit and 64 bit systems that comply to POSIX or current Windows/MacOS standards. Practically, this means we only call C99 standard library functions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{To Do}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item Basic features.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item Incorporate \texttt{\#if\ 0}ed parts of \texttt{emb-stitch-fill.c}.
  \item Interpret how to write formats that have a read mode from the source
    code and vice versa.
  \item Identify sources that break down the binary formats we currently
    don't understand.
  \item Better documentation of the structure of the headers for the formats
    we do understand.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Code quality and user friendliness.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item Document all structs, macros and functions (will contribute directly
    on the web version).
  \item Make a texinfo/PDF user manual for embroider.
  \item Incorporate experimental code, improve support for language
    bindings.
  \item Make stitch x, y into an EmbVector.
  \end{enumerate}
\item embroider CLI

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item Make -circle flag to add a circle to the current pattern.
  \item Make -rect flag to add a rectangle to the current pattern.
  \item Make -fill flag to set the current satin fill algorithm for the
    current geometry. (for example ``-fill crosses -circle 11,13,10''
    fills a circle with center 11mm, 13mm with radius 10mm with
    crosses).
  \item Make -ellipse flag to add to ellipse to the current pattern.
  \item Make -bezier flag to add a bezier curve to the current pattern.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Improve embedded compatibility.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item Remove reliance on slower, memory expensive parts of the C Standard
    Library that are in the main library, for example, not using printf,
    sprintf, fprintf etc. (Use embFile\_puts.)
  \item Share heavy memory usage between functions, for example use
    embBuffer for buffering headers rather than having a seperate
    \texttt{char\ header{[}{]}} variables.
  \item Reduce calls to malloc when we know the total usage as dynamic
    memory may not be present and we may need to get rid of malloc
    entirely.
  \item Consider using an alternative C standard library for the remaining
    functions like uclibc.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finding fixes}

To find jobs marked within the source code rather than the list above,
use:

\begin{verbatim}
grep "TODO" *.c *.h
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Testing}

Build \texttt{embroider} then run:

\begin{verbatim}
./embroider -test &> report.txt
\end{verbatim}

If any of the tests return a fail in the summary (see
\texttt{tail\ report.txt}) then it would help the project to send us an
issue attatching the file to your message along with a description of
the system you ran the program on.

\section{On Arduino}

The library is designed to support embedded environments.

\subsection{Compatible Boards}

We recommend using an Arduino Mega 2560 or another board with equal or
greater specs. That being said, we have had success using an Arduino Uno
R3 but this will likely require further optimization and other
improvements to ensure continued compatibility with the Uno. See below
for more information.

\subsection{Arduino Considerations}

There are two main concerns here: Flash Storage \& SRAM.

libembroidery continually outgrows the 32KB of Flash storage on the
Arduino Uno and every time this occurs, a decision has to be made as to
what capabilities should be included or omitted. While reading files is
the main focus on arduino, writing files may also play a bigger role in
the future. Long term, it would be most practical to handle the
inclusion or omission of any feature via a single configuration header
file that the user can modify to suit their needs.

SRAM is in extremely limited supply and it will deplete quickly so any
dynamic allocation should occur early during the setup phase of the
sketch and sparingly or not at all later in the sketch. To help minimize
SRAM consumption on Arduino and ensure libembroidery can be used in any
way the sketch creator desires, it is required that any sketch using
libembroidery must implement event handlers. See the ino-event source
and header files for more information.

There is also an excellent article by Bill Earl on the Adafruit Learning
System which covers these topics in more depth:
http://learn.adafruit.com/memories-of-an-arduino?view=all

\subsection{Special Notes}

Due to historical reasons and to remain compatible with the Arduino 1.0
IDE, this folder must be called ``utility''. Refer to the arduino build
process for more info:
https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.19/sketch-build-process/

libembroidery relies on the Arduino SD library for reading files. See
the ino-file source and header files for more information.

\subsection{Experimental Projects}

Anything contained within the experimental/ folder is unstable and
unsupported. Items in here may eventually be moved elsewhere or may not.
If you have an interesting concept or prototype that you would like us
to add, contact us and we may add it here.

\subsection{Dependencies}

To build additional language bindings for libembroidery from source you
will need at least:

Ubuntu repository packages:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get install swig python-dev
\end{verbatim}

Mac

\begin{verbatim}
brew install swig
\end{verbatim}

An example for building for use in C\#

\begin{verbatim}
swig -csharp -o ./csharp/binding/swig_wrap.c -I../ swig.i
\end{verbatim}

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\end{center}


\begin{center}
{\bf Preamble}
\end{center}

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document ``free'' in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of ``copyleft'', which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


\begin{center}
{\bf 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The ``\textbf{Document}'', below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as ``\textbf{you}''.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A ``\textbf{Modified Version}'' of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A ``\textbf{Secondary Section}'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The ``\textbf{Invariant Sections}'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The ``\textbf{Cover Texts}'' are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A ``\textbf{Transparent}'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``\textbf{Opaque}''.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The ``\textbf{Title Page}'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The ``\textbf{publisher}'' means any person or entity that distributes
copies of the Document to the public.

A section ``\textbf{Entitled XYZ}'' means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as ``\textbf{Acknowledgements}'',
``\textbf{Dedications}'', ``\textbf{Endorsements}'', or ``\textbf{History}''.)  
To ``\textbf{Preserve the Title}''
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section ``Entitled XYZ'' according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


\begin{center}
{\bf 2. VERBATIM COPYING\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section~3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


\begin{center}
{\bf 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}


If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


\begin{center}
{\bf 4. MODIFICATIONS\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

\begin{itemize}
\item[A.] 
   Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
   
\item[B.]
   List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
   
\item[C.]
   State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
   
\item[D.]
   Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
   
\item[E.]
   Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
   
\item[F.]
   Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
   
\item[G.]
   Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
   
\item[H.]
   Include an unaltered copy of this License.
   
\item[I.]
   Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
   
\item[J.]
   Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
   
\item[K.]
   For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'',
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
   
\item[L.]
   Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
   
\item[M.]
   Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''.  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
   
\item[N.]
   Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements''
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
   
\item[O.]
   Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
\end{itemize}

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties---for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


\begin{center}
{\bf 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}


You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section~4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History''
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''.  You must delete all sections
Entitled ``Endorsements''.

\begin{center}
{\bf 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


\begin{center}
{\bf 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}


A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section~3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


\begin{center}
{\bf 8. TRANSLATION\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}


Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section~4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'',
``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section~4) to Preserve
its Title (section~1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


\begin{center}
{\bf 9. TERMINATION\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}


You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


\begin{center}
{\bf 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}


The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
\texttt{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/}.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.


\begin{center}
{\bf 11. RELICENSING\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}


``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site'' (or ``MMC Site'') means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration'' (or ``MMC'') contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

``CC-BY-SA'' means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

``Incorporate'' means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is ``eligible for relicensing'' if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


\begin{center}
{\bf ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents\par}
\phantomsection
\end{center}

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

\bigskip
\begin{quote}
    Copyright \copyright{}  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
    Free Documentation License''.
\end{quote}
\bigskip
    
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the ``with \dots\ Texts.''\ line with this:

\bigskip
\begin{quote}
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
\end{quote}
\bigskip
    
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
