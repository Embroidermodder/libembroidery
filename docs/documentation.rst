The Developer Manual
--------------------

The Embroidermodder Reference Manual (EMRM) is the main developer resource, available as
`PDF (A4) <https://www.libembroidery.org/downloads/emrm_a4.pdf>`_
and `PDF (US letter) <https://www.libembroidery.org/downloads/emrm_us_letter.pdf>`_.
This includes the libembroidery API documentation, as those who build software that uses the
same core functions would need a lot of the same information.

It is maintained as LaTeX source code in the `documentation repository <https://github.com/Embroidermodder/docs>`_.
We advise any developers wishing to improve the code find problems here first since a mistake in documentation
could be copied into all the other projects and it would be the easiest one to find errors
in and make improvements to.
