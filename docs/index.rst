   IN ALPHA DEVELOPMENT: NOT READY FOR SERIOUS USE.

Embroidermodder is a free and open source machine embroidery application.
If our project is successful, it will:

  * edit and create embroidery designs
  * estimate the amount of thread and machine time needed to stitch a design
  * convert embroidery files to a variety of formats
  * upscale or downscale designs
  * run on Windows, Mac and Linux

To try out the software in alpha see our `downloads page <https://libembroidery.org/downloads>`_.

Various sample embroidery design files can be found in
the github samples folder.

If you use multiple operating systems, it's important to choose
software that works on all of them. Embroidermodder 2 runs on Windows,
Linux and Mac OS X. Let's not forget the `Raspberry Pi <https://www.raspberrypi.org>`_.

History
-------

Embroidermodder 1 was started by Mark Pontius in 2004 while staying up all night
with his son in his first couple months. When Mark returned to his day job, he
lacked the time to continue the project. Mark made the decision to focus on his
family and work, and in 2005, Mark gave full control of the project to Josh Varga
so that Embroidermodder could continue its growth.

Embroidermodder 2 was conceived in mid 2011 when Jonathan Greig and Josh Varga
discussed the possibility of making a cross-platform version. It is currently in
active development and will run on GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and
Raspberry Pi.

The source code and binaries for Embroidermodder 1 were hosted on Sourceforge, but
due to link rot we've lost them.

.. warning::

   TODO: upload a backup here.

The `source code for Embroidermodder 2 <https://github.com/Embroidermodder/Embroidermodder>`_
was moved to GitHub on July 18, 2013.

`This website <https://github.com/Embroidermodder/docs>`_ was moved
to GitHub on September 9, 2013. Due to us losing the domain name it was renamed
to ``www.libembroidery.org`` from ``www.embroidermodder.org``.

The `libembroidery library <https://github.com/Embroidermodder/libembroidery>`_
became a seperate project in 2018 as a way of supporting other frontends with
the same file parsing and geometry routines.
